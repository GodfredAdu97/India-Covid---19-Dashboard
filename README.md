Your task is to create a Power BI dashboard that offers visualizations and insights into the COVID-19 pandemic ' s progression and impact.
Narrative and Insights 

	The total number of confirmed covid-19 cases was 5452 million across 46 states in India.

	Deeper delve into the data reveals that most of the cases were recorded during the 2nd quarter of the year.

	It could also be observed that the southern part of India recorded the most cases, with the western part with the lowest.

	A total 73M deaths were recorded during the period.

	Maharashtra is the state with the highest number of confirmed covid cases
	The total number of recoveries was 332 million which is equivalent 6.09% of the total number of confirmed covid cases.
	It is interesting to note that number of vaccinations doesn’t correlate with the number recoveries, i.e those with higher vaccination number don’t necessarily have recovery number, what other factors could lead to recoveries?
